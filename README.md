Juvenile Justice: Examining Bias in Facility Security Levels and Resource Availability 

By Jane Andrews and Nandini Nag

Abstract:
Using data and new technology in the criminal justice system is not a novel idea, as seen by Northepointe’s Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) model. While much research has been done on the validity and accuracy of this recidivism model, less attention has been given to how early interactions with the juvenile justice system influence these outcomes. In this study, we inspect whether racial biases exist in juvenile correctional facilities by analyzing whether facilities with majority Black populations are subject to higher security levels as opposed to their White counterparts. Utilizing a variety of fairness tools – exploratory data analysis, counterfactual predictive analysis, NLP analysis, fairness evaluation metrics, etc. – we continue to broaden the discussion on systemic bias in the criminal justice system.

Data
The main dataset used in our analysis is the publicly available Census of Public and Private Juvenile Detention, Correctional, and Shelter Facilities, 1986-1987: [United States]. These data include the population, demographics, and characteristics of every facility holding youths in custody in the United States in early 1987.
